### Hello, you!

Heyo, I'm Richard. Online, you'll usually find me going by ***Shoonkey***!

#### $ whoami --tldr

I'm a *software developer* specialized in frontend webdevelopment. I have 2+ years of professional full-stack experience working mainly with Vue, React, Express and Node, mostly back in 2020.

Besides that, in the following years, I've done automation scripts in Python, taught private webdev classes on full-stack with PHP and on basic scripting with Java and native web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), among other endeavors.

#### $ whoami --what-im-up-to

I have recently taken interest in Angular, C# and Python, trying out building UIs, APIs and computer vision projects with them. Newer technologies like Rust and Tauri also really interest me and I wanna get around to trying them in the future.

I speak Brazilian Portuguese and English fluently, and learning languages is one of my favorite hobbies! I've dabbled in many of them (which means my Duolingo profile is an *absolute mess*) and I tend to always be learning at least one at any given point. :)

I'm passionate about art: writing, music, drawing, philosophizing, coding, *learning*. I wish these things were more appreciated and talked about, and I do my best to be involved with these things.
