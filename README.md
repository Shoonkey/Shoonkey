## About me

Hello there, I'm Richard! :sparkles:

I'm currently looking for work.

I'm a full-stack developer with 2 years of experience, mainly focused in frontend. I speak English and Portuguese; I started learning to code when I was 11 years old using Khan Academy and Codecademy and since then, I have worked with React, Vue, Node, Express, MySQL and PostgreSQL. I am focused, organized, learn fast and like teamwork.

My portfolio and a bunch of my projects are open-source, shared here on Github!

### Experience

I've worked as a full-stack developer both as a freelancer and as an IT assistant at the IT department of a Brazilian clothing store called Monju√°. The techs I've gotten my hands on professionally so far are Node, React, Vue, Express, PostgreSQL and MySQL.

I speak English at upper-intermediate level and Brazilian Portuguese fluently.
