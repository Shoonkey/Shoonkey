## Hello, fellow open-source human!

:sparkles: Heyo, I'm Richard. Here on the internet I usually go by Shoonkey!

### Intro

I'm a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience, mainly focused in frontend. I got into coding around 2013, when I learned Javascript, jQuery, ProcessingJS; since then, I have mostly worked with Javascript technologies to build websites full-stack with NodeJS and some of its related frameworks (more details on this a bit ahead).

My portfolio and a bunch of my projects are open-source, shared here on Github!

### Experience and stack

I started my career back in 2019 as an archivist in a Brazilian clothing store called Monju√°, soon joining its IT department as an IT assistant, where I helped develop and maintain internal web applications. I've briefly re-entered the market back in 2022, working as a freelancer developer in frontend, backend and full-stack development.

I have mostly worked with NodeJS, using technologies like Express, React, Vue, Next, and Vuetify, and using MySQL and PostgreSQL as databases.

I speak English at upper-intermediate level and Brazilian Portuguese fluently.

### My force...! It's over nine thousaaaaaand!!!

For a better look at my projects, contact info or my CV, you can take a peek at my public repos!

`portfolio` is my most recent iteration of a portfolio website, the previous having been `portfolio-v1`. I have made projects such as a Discord bot that does a silly encryption I made up with a friend, in [this repo](https://github.com/Shoonkey/puban-bot) and an app to help study music theory, over [here](https://github.com/Shoonkey/music-theory-study).
