## Hello, fellow open-source human!

:sparkles: Heyo, I'm Richard. Here on the internet I usually go by Shoonkey!

I'm currently **looking for work**!

### Intro

I'm a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience, mainly focused in frontend. I got into coding around 2013, learning Javascript, jQuery, ProcessingJS and since then, I have worked with React, Vue, Node, Express, MySQL and PostgreSQL. I am focused, organized, learn fast and like teamwork.

My portfolio and a bunch of my projects are open-source, shared here on Github!

### Experience and stack

I started my career back in 2019 as an archivist in a Brazilian clothing store called Monju√°, soon joining its IT department as an IT assistant, where I helped develop and maintain internal web applications. I've re-entered the market in 2022 and have been working as a freelancer developer since then, having worked in frontend, backend and full-stack development. I also have worked with Wix and Wordpress.

My favorite stack is Node, Express, React, NextJS and PostgreSQL, but I have also worked with Vue and Oracle MySQL.

I speak English at upper-intermediate level and Brazilian Portuguese fluently.
